                        <strong>Limitation of liability</strong>
                        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Raven Road or any of its employees, agents, partners, service providers, content providers or licensors, nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, regardless of the cause, whether for breach of warranty, breach of contract, product liability, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, arising out of the use of or inability to use the Websites or Apps, or resulting from the content and other information contained therein.
                            These Terms of Use, your access to or use of the Websites or Apps or your inability to access or use the Websites or Apps or any content obtained from the Websites or Apps, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                            The user assumes all risks that he/she has the experience, suitable vehicle and driving skills necessary to safely complete the rides and routes available on the Raven Road app, whether the rides or routes are created by the user or by Raven Road. The user assumes all risks related to the difficulty of the ride or route, weather conditions, traffic situations, physical conditions of the road or terrain, the presence of other vehicles and any other risks that the user may encounter while traveling on the rides or routes on the app.
                            In no event will Raven Road's total liability, in the aggregate for all claims subject to these Terms of Use, exceed the greater of two hundred fifty dollars (EUR 250.00) or the amount you have paid us in the last year for accessing our websites and applications.
                            You acknowledge that Raven Road would not be able to provide you with access to its websites or applications if these limitations were not in place, and that these limitations of liability are essential elements of the Terms of Use. These limitations of liability reflect an allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations set forth in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy set forth in the Terms of Use fails of its essential purpose.
                            Because some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability in all circumstances, in such jurisdictions Raven Road's liability will be limited to the extent permitted by law.

                        <strong>Applicable law and dispute resolution</strong>
                        <p>Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or your use of our websites or applications shall be subject to Polish law.
                            Disputes will be resolved by common courts with jurisdiction in accordance with the law.

                        <br/>
                        <strong>Mediation and Arbitration Agreement</strong>
                        <p>Any dispute, claim or cause of action between you and Raven Road, including those arising out of or relating to our websites and applications, any benefits associated therewith, these Terms and Conditions, or our Privacy Policy, that cannot be resolved through informal discussions shall first be submitted to mediation conducted by the Polish Mediation Center (“PCM”) in accordance with its Commercial Mediation Procedures before recourse to binding arbitration.
                            Any dispute, claim or cause of action not resolved through mediation will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by PCM under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
                            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable PCM rules, and we will reimburse these fees if your claim is less than EUR 10,000. Similarly, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in the arbitration.
                            Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any Polish court of competent jurisdiction.

                        </p>

                        <strong>Comments:</strong>
                        <p>1.	Mediation in Poland is a voluntary process and PCM offers appropriate procedures.
                            2.	Binding arbitration in Poland is regulated by the Arbitration Act, and arbitration awards have the force of court judgments.
                            3.	The costs of mediation and arbitration are regulated in the agreements, and reimbursement of costs is possible for claims below a set amount.
                            4.	The arbitration award is enforceable in Polish common courts.

                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>Exclusions from arbitration</strong>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Raven Road may elect to litigate a dispute in court rather than through arbitration if the dispute qualifies for small claims court. Raven Road may also seek injunctive, compensatory or other appropriate relief in a Polish court if the dispute involves infringement or threatened infringement of our intellectual property rights.
                            Any disputes brought by you or Raven Road in court will be resolved by a court located in the Masovian Voivodeship, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>
                        <p>You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or relating to our websites and applications, these Terms and Conditions, or our Privacy Policy shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class or mass action.
                            This provision will not be construed as a waiver of your right to seek public injunctive relief under California law, to the extent such right may be available to you.

                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>Time limit</strong>
                        <p>You agree to bring any claim against Raven Road within one year after the cause of action accrues. Any claim brought after that time will be deemed barred.
                        </p>

                            •	The license granted to you in these Terms of Use is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Raven Road App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and that you own or control, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Use.

                            •	You represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a Polish government embargo, or that has been designated by the Polish government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (2) you are not listed on any Polish government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
                            •	Any questions, complaints or claims regarding our mobile applications should be directed to us using the information provided in the “Contact Us” section below.
                            •	You and Raven Road acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms of Use, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Use against you.

                        <p>No delay or failure by Raven Road to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall constitute a waiver of any of Raven Road's rights. Neither the receipt of any funds by Raven Road nor any person's reliance on our performance shall be deemed a waiver of any part of these Terms of Use. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of Raven Road shall have legal effect.
